Intelligent Street Light Automation Using IoT Sensors and Real-Time Data Analytics

Project Overview

The Intelligent Street Light Automation system is designed to optimize energy consumption, reduce maintenance costs, and enhance public safety by leveraging IoT sensors and real-time data analytics. This project offers a smart lighting solution that dynamically adjusts illumination levels based on environmental conditions and activity levels.

Features

Automated Control: Lights automatically adjust based on motion detection, ambient light levels, and environmental conditions.

Energy Optimization: Reduces power consumption by turning lights on only when necessary.

Real-Time Data Analytics: Collects and analyzes data to provide insights on energy usage and maintenance needs.

Enhanced Safety: Ensures well-lit surroundings to improve security and visibility.

Tech Stack

IoT Sensors: Motion sensors, light sensors, and temperature sensors.

Real-Time Data Analytics: Utilized to monitor system performance and optimize functionality.

Hardware Platforms: ESP32 microcontroller for sensor data management and control logic.
